I do Condensed Matter Theory research at the Physics Department of Michigan State University with my advisor [Mark Dykman](http://www.pa.msu.edu/~dykman/). Below 
are descriptions of two major fields I am interested in.

<h2>Nonlinearities in micro- and nanomechanical systems </h2>

Micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems (MEMS and NEMS) usually consist of a tiny vibrational device and some electric circuitry. They may be small enough to 
see quantum phenomena but large enough to be measured individually. They are also extremely sensitive to small external forces. That is why these systems are 
extensively studied and widely used as sensors in industry. An important feature of MEMS and NEMS is their nonlinearity which is typically strong. 
Nonlinearity means that the restoring force is not proportional to displacement. This leads to a variety of phenomena known in the field of Nonlinear Dynamics.
I study the origins of nonlinearity in MEMS and NEMS made of doped silicon. Electron-phonon interaction in silicon leads to redistribution of electrons
between conduction band valleys when the crystal is deformed. This effect significantly modifies the nonlinear part of the elastic forces. It also
leads to the modified temperature dependence of frequency. The results of our work are available in the following paper:

<h2>Dynamics of strongly correlated electrons on the surface of liquid helium </h2>
My current interest is the dynamics of strongly correlated electrons on the surface of liquid helium. 
In this system, electrons form a perfect two-dimensional electron layer with very little interaction
with helium surface. This situation is uniquely suited to study the physics of strongly-correlated electron systems.
Depending on the electron density, one can observe a range of states, from an ideal [Fermi gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_gas)
to a [Wigner crystal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigner_crystal). In between those two states, electrons are in a liquid-like phase with unique properties.
