I'm a Physics PhD student at Michigan State University with a focus in Condensed Matter Theory.
I greatly enjoy learning and applying my knowledge to solve challenging problems. Learning is my lifestyle.
Besides Physics, I'm curious about a variety of topics, including  programming, Economics, Psychology, photography, music, and literature. I even have a degree in Economics.
